		<h1>Profile</h1>
		<p>I am a student at Trinity Christian College. I am majoring in mathematics and minoring in computer science. I hope to one day teach mathematics at the community college level. My dream would be to work at Moraine Valley with my father, who teaches computer science there. I've taught lego robotics and simple programming to children with my dad through Moraine Valley since I was 14. I rescued a pointer/pit mix (pictured above). I hope to one day rescue a blue nosed pit-bull. My passion include basketball and drawing. I would some day like to work part time as a tattoo artist. I have already worked designing tattoos for various people.</p>
